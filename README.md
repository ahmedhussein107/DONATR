# DONATR

## Introduction
Welcome to DONATR, a donation website built using React JS. Our platform aims to bridge the gap between donors, donation receivers, and charity organizations by facilitating communication and enabling seamless transactions.

## Features
- **Donation Requests:** Users can create posts requesting donations or offering services for free. These requests serve as a means for individuals and organizations to connect and support each other.
- **User Profiles:** Each user has a profile where they can manage their donation requests, track their donation history, and engage with other users.
- **Search and Filter:** Easily find donation requests based on specific criteria such as location, category, or urgency.
- **Secure Transactions:** We prioritize the security of all transactions on our platform, ensuring a safe and reliable environment for both donors and receivers.
